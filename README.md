## Project Overview

This E-Commerce web application is developed using Django as the backend framework, Vue.js for frontend interactivity, and GraphQL for efficient data retrieval. The project is divided into several parts:

### Part One: Set Up the Django Project with Docker

1. **Launch Your Django Project**: Set up the Django project, create a virtual environment, and install the necessary Python packages.

2. **Containerize Your Project**: Create Dockerfiles and Docker Compose configuration to containerize the Django application and any required services.

### Part Two: Setting Up HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Vue.js

1. **Set Up HTML and Tailwind CSS**: Create HTML templates for Django views and apply Tailwind CSS classes for styling.

2. **Set Up JavaScript and Implement Vue.js**: Install Vue.js, set up Vue.js components, and integrate them into Django templates for interactivity.

### Part Three: Setting Up Models, Views, and GraphQL

1. **Set Up Each Model**: Create Django models representing database tables, generate views for CRUD operations, and create HTML templates for data presentation.

2. **Generate Exceptions and Set Up GraphQL**: Implement error handling, raise custom exceptions, and set up GraphQL queries and mutations to interact with Django models.

### Part Four: Final Steps

1. **Generate Error Handling and Add Missing Components**: Continuously improve error handling and address any missing components or features.

2. **Deploy Your App to the Cloud**: Choose a cloud platform, configure cloud services, and deploy the Django application for public access.
