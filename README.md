## Project Overview

This E-Commerce web application is developed using FastAPI as the backend framework and React.js for frontend interactivity. The project is divided into several parts:

### Part One: Set Up the FastAPI Project with Docker

1. **Launch Your FastAPI Project**: Set up the FastAPI project, create a virtual environment, and install the necessary Python packages.

2. **Containerize Your Project**: Create Dockerfiles and Docker Compose configuration to containerize the FastAPI application and any required services.

### Part Two: Setting Up React.js

1. **Set Up React.js**: Create a new React.js application in a separate directory or within this repository.

2. **Implement Components**: Develop React.js components for different parts of your application's frontend.

### Part Three: Setting Up API Endpoints

1. **Set Up API Endpoints**: Define API endpoints using FastAPI for data retrieval and interaction.

2. **Integrate React.js with FastAPI**: Make API requests from your React.js components to interact with the FastAPI backend.

### Part Four: Final Steps

1. **Generate Error Handling and Add Missing Components**: Continuously improve error handling and address any missing components or features in your React.js frontend and FastAPI backend.

2. **Deploy Your App**: Choose a hosting platform, configure cloud services, and deploy both the FastAPI backend and React.js frontend for public access.
