3. **Client-Side Features**: Implement features like product listing, search functionality, and user authentication for clients.

### Part Two: Admin Dashboard

This part is dedicated to administrators who need to manage the website, view statistics, and perform various backend tasks.

#### Getting Started with Admin Dashboard

1. **Launch the Admin Dashboard**: Set up the Django project for the admin dashboard, create a separate virtual environment, and install the necessary Python packages.
